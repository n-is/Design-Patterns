# Design_Patterns
-----------------

This is a simple project related to design patterns that I have started
learning recently. I am learning design patterns from "Design Patterns :
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". I created this repository so
that not only could I learn from the huge open source community, but also be
helpful to future learners.
